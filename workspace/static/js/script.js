// Key features: Handles adding new tasks to the list., Manages marking tasks as complete/incomplete., Implements functionality for deleting tasks., Interacts with the DOM to update the UI based on user actions., Potentially includes logic for data persistence (e.g., using `localStorage`)., Contains event listeners for user interactions (clicks, form submissions).
