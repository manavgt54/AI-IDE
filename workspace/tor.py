    Calculates the sum of two integer numbers.

    This function takes two integers and returns their sum. It includes
    basic type validation to ensure robust operation and adherence to
    expected input types.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first integer number.
        num2 (int): The second integer number.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of num1 and num2.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If either num1 or num2 is not an integer, indicating
                   an invalid input for the calculation.
